            <p>The purpose of this website is to show others different traveling ideas and how to have a fun time with traveling. I had an idea to compile my bucket list and to show the rating of my already experienced adventures. I also want to have a page to plan when to go and how to save the money to go. I also want a place where people could suggest places to go and how to have the best time. </p>
            <li><b>Home</b></li>
                <p>On this page, I would put a brief description of my travels and why my bucket list is important. I would then list a several different types of bucket List. For example, I would do one for when I am home in Wyoming and what I would do there. I would also like one for places I would like to travel in the US, Road Trips, International, Family trips, basically I would like to split my bucket list into subcategories.</p>
            <li><b>My Travels</b></li>
                <p>This page would consist of pictures and adventures that I have already been on. It would rate the adventures, and give descriptions of what went good, what went bad, and how to make it better.  </p>
            <li><b>Planning</b></li>
                <p>On this page, I would have how to schedule trips and how to save money for the trips. (Iâ€™m still thinking about this page and how it would work.)</p>
            <li><b>Tips</b></li>
                <p>This page would be a page on how to have the most fun, and how to make your trip enjoyable. It would be a travel tips page. </p>
            <li><b>Suggestions</b></li>
                <p>This page would be a page where the viewers can leave input and suggestions for more bucket list ideas, or how they had a really good trip and why it was so successful.</p>
