            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Most of the time you can, there are times that it doesn't work as well. The biggest web page that I had problems with was I-Learn. It was hard to see what I needed to see. </p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>Most of the time I could see what I wanted. There was time that I had to search around and find what I needed. Again, the biggest web page I problems with is I-Learn.  </p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I often found that you can get where you want to go faster on the mobile. It is simplified and I really like that </p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Yes, there are times that you couldn't click on what you need to, it would often give me a slight head ache to try to navigate on some web page.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>The good web pages had good form and better ways to get around the page. </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>What did you learn? Where there any surprises?
                I found that there were a lot of differences, I often would get mad because I couldn't click on what I wanted to. There are times that the mobile was better but often I would rather go with the desktop.
            </p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
                <li><a href="" target="_blank">Name of site</a></li>
